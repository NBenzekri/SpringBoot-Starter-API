# Spring boot API / Swagger UI Starter

 This is a starter REST api project based on Spring Boot framework, well docummented with Swagger2 UI [**localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**](http://104.248.36.3:8080/swagger-ui.html)<br> 

The api/docs are secured using Spring Security Authentication 

For test it uses h2 database.

I've decided to create such starter project to make it as a template to start any new spring boot api project and to win too much time and to be more productive unstead of doing repititive tasks.

## The project has the MVC structured  

I'll add every time a new feature.

stay tuned :)
